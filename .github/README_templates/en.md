- An object remains after the ex skill if the ex skill type is "leaving something in a place".
  - The object doesn't affect the game at all.
  - The object will be remove when the hit boxes of a block and it are overlapped.
  - You can also remove the object by right-clicking the action of the ex skill.

  ![Placement object](../README_images/placement_object.jpg)

- Press cursor keys (↑→↓←) to show speech bubbles.
  - The "reload" speech bubble will appear automatically while loading a crossbow.

  ![Speech bubble 2](../README_images/bubble_reload.jpg)

- Holds the character's specific weapon instead of bows and crossbows. Shoots bullets instead of arrows.
  - Note that these changes are only in appearance. You are just shooting arrows in actual.

  ![Gun](../README_images/gun.jpg)

- A barrier will applied when the player has absorption hearts (yellow hearts).

  ![Barrier](../README_images/barrier.jpg)

- Will be rescued by the helicopter when the player dies.
  - This animation won't visible if the player isn't visible because of Minecraft and Figura specifications.

- Can change costume if the character has multiple costumes.

  ![Costume](../README_images/costume.jpg)

- Can change your display name to the character's name.
  - Can also display the club name which the character is participated in.
  - **Other players also need to install Figura and give enough permissions** to see your display name.

  ![Display name](../README_images/display_name.jpg)

## The action wheel
Figura provides the action wheel with which players can play some actions (emotes, animations, configs, and etc.). It will be shown when holding the action wheel key (default is B key). This avatar also has some actions.

![Action wheel](../README_images/action_wheel.jpg)

### Action 1. Ex skill
Plays the ex skill animation. Only in the third person view.

![Ex skill](../README_images/ex_skill.jpg)

### Action 2. Change costume
Changes costume if the character has multiple costumes. Scroll to select the costume and closing the action wheel to confirm. Left-click to reset to current selection, and right-clock to reset to default during selection.

### Action 3. Change display name
Changes the player's display name. Scroll to select the name and closing the action wheel to confirm. Left-click to reset to current selection, and right-clock to reset to default during selection. However, **Other players also need to install Figura and give enough permissions** to see your display name.

![Display name](../README_images/display_name_2.jpg)

### Action 4. Toggle armors visible
Toggles whether equipped armors are visible or not. Some costumes will be hidden not to interfere with the armors while equips them. This setting will only affects to vanilla armors.

I recommend to hide armors because they hide the avatar.
